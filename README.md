# My-BMI-Calculator
 
The body mass index (BMI) is a measurement based on a person's mass (weight) and height. The BMI is calculated by dividing the body weight by the square of the height, and it is expressed in kilogrammes per square metre (kg/m2) since weight is measured in kilogrammes and height is measured in metres. A table or chart that presents BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories and that may also utilise other units of measurement can be used to calculate BMI (converted to metric units for the calculation).

Based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height, the BMI is a practical guideline used to roughly classify a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese are the four main adult BMI categories (30 or more). The BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some of the alternatives when used to predict an individual's health rather than as a statistical assessment for groups, particularly when applied to people with abdominal obesity, low stature, or very high muscle mass.

Higher all-cause mortality has been linked to BMIs under 20 and above 25, with the risk rising as BMIs move away from the 20â€“25 range.
